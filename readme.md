### Downloads songs and playslists from YouTube

I initially intented to make this tool to download entire playlists at once.

This tools downloads in the highest audio quality using ytdl and then proceses with ffmpeg to convert from opus to mp3.

## How to use

Run this command
```ts
npm start
```
Then you can type any link to a YouTube video or playlist, or any link to a soundcloud track, and it will download it.
